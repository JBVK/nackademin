# Adding a SSH key to a Linux user
This guide will show you how to add a ssh key to a the new Linux user you have created.

## Notes about the lesson
You will see a lot of commands in this lesson, like sudo, su, chmod, that I will not describe in great details. These we will look at in upcoming lessons.

## Create a SSH key
First we must create a SSH key to use. This should be done on the computer from where you will be connecting, probably your laptop.

**This part of the guide will not work for those of you using Putty. You will need to follow this [guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen)**

To create the ssh-key you will run this command:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

You will be prompted to specify in what file the key should be saved (specify filenamn and location).
It will default to your SSH folder (/home/username/.ssh) and filename id_rsa.

I would recommend creating all SSH-keys in your .ssh folder but give it a name so you easily can see what the key is for.
This will create the SSH key ec2_mynewuser in my .ssh folder (username is your username).

```bash
ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/username/.ssh/ec2_mynewuser
```

You will be promted to add a passphrase (password). This will need to be entered every time you use the SSH-key.

As a best practice you should always add a passphrase to a SSH key that you will use for anything important. But since this is just a test server we can skip it.
Just press enter without enter a passphrase.


If you check your .ssh folder you will see that you have two new files.
```bash
ls .ssh/
authorized_keys  ec2_mynewuser  ec2_mynewuser.pub
```

The key with .pub is your public key and the one without is your private key.

We are now done with creating the SSH-key.


## SSH to the EC2
SSH to the EC2.

```bash
ssh ec2-user@EC2-external-ip -i your_ec2_pem_key
```

## Become the new user
To add the ssh key to your other Linux user we will need to become them.
This is done by running this command:

```bash
sudo su - username
```

You will see that your terminal changes from writing ec2-user@ip-address to username@ip-address at the beginning of the terminal line.

You can also verity that you are your new user by running the command:

```bash
whoami
```

It will print your username

## Creating SSH folder
All commands here should be run when logged in as the new user and being in that users homefolder.

To be able to SSH to a Linux instance with a SSH key it will need to verify that the key is correct. 
By defaut SSH will check in the .ssh folder of the user that is trying to connect. That folder should be located in the users homefolder.
The period before the name specifies that the folder is "secret", it cant be seen by a regular ls command. You will need to use the ls command with the -a flag to see secret folders.

Create the folder with this command:

```bash
mkdir .ssh
```

We will need to change the permissions of the .ssh folder cause SSH will not allow usage of files in it otherwise due to security reasons.
To change the permissions run this command.

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh
```

## Create authorized_keys file
All commands here should be run when logged in as the new user and being in that users homefolder if not specified where to run them.

After the .ssh folder is created we need to create the file that SSH will check for authorized SSH keys in.

That file is named autorized_keys.
Since we havnÂ´t talked about text editors yet (will be done in lesson 2) we will create the file and add the ssh-key to it in separate steps without using a text editor.

To create the file run this command:
```bash
touch .ssh/authorized_keys
```

We must also change permissions on the file so that SSH will allow usage of it.
```bash
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Copy public SSH-key to authorized keys
We are now ready to copy the public ssh key to the authorized_keys file.

**ON YOUR COMPUTER** (where you created the SSH-key) IN YOUR HOMEFOLDER.
In this example my key is called ec2_mynewuser

Lets copy the public key. The easiest way to do this is to use a command called cat to print the file to the terminal.

```bash
cat .ssh/ec2_mynewuser.pub
```

The output will be somthing like this:
```bash
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDRidALpfSR711pBhDhzlj2sF8hBmkvK92NNaISxAI
fwkUOSEOphVnofz80mnwRPM56rCX0hpRoahy4f3/U9reJzBjGsgs2LhCZv0f5Ss7MfwR4G/rIGfhyLp
Wi1h3ygl98uffroqOzpZFjHfDErQe0N4T3qCuwHCZ9XBC3XGGtrYWIe0xLiGYpbMz1SF54nHnDV5Aul

MkZeirB8GNWI+1El3i8cuCVfZA0n11emiBxijd+s8SSKGC+awg0P9FTegI4PKUuBlGX983yVAOoiT8N/
HHqzHSz+8MSwNxYWzN25oIcdx9B4zfMpfvozCptHvEO87lv5qkcFI8CGM= ec2-user@jenkinsserver
```

Highlight everything from ssh-rsa to the end of the key, in my case ec2-user@jenkinsserver (this will be your username and computername), with your mouse and copy it (ctrl + c for Windows/Linux and CMD + c for Mac).

**ON THE EC2 INSTANCE** as the new user in its homefolder, we will now copy the key to authorized_keys.

Start with writing echo "", in between the " " we will copy the SSH-key. We will then add >> after the key and after that write .ssh/authorized_keys. 
This will then echo everything between "" to .ssh/authorized_keys.

I will shorten my SSH-key to make it easier to read here.
```bash
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDRidALpfSR7....CGM= ec2-user@jenkinsserver" >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

To verify that it worked, lets check authorized_keys.
```bash
cat .ssh/authorized_keys
```
You should see your public key be printed to the terminal.

## SSH with the new key

You should now be able to ssh to the new user with the SSH key.

```bash
ssh mynewuser@EC2-external-ip -i .ssh/ec2_mynewuser
```
